    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that incorporates regularization into the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. It differs from other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, primarily in the way it penalizes the coefficients.\n",

    "2\n",
    "L \n",
    "2\n",
    "​\n",
    "  norm), which does not lead to sparsity and generally shrinks coefficients towards zero without eliminating them entirely.\n",
    "OLS Regression, the simplest form of regression, does not include a penalty term and estimates coefficients solely based on minimizing the sum of squared residuals.\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is particularly effective for feature selection, as it tends to set some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively eliminating less important predictors from the model.\n",
    "This feature selection property of Lasso Regression is valuable in situations where there are many predictors, some of which may be irrelevant or redundant.\n",
    "In contrast, Ridge Regression does not perform feature selection as explicitly, as it only shrinks coefficients towards zero without eliminating any entirely.\n",
    "OLS Regression includes all predictors in the model, regardless of their importance or relevance unless feature selection techniques are applied separately.\n",
    "Impact of Regularization Parameter:\n",
    "\n",

    "λ) in Lasso Regression controls the strength of regularization and the degree of sparsity in the coefficient estimates.\n",

    "Automatic Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression performs feature selection automatically as part of the modeling process. It selects a subset of predictors that are most relevant for predicting the target variable while discarding irrelevant or redundant predictors.\n",

    "Improved Generalization Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection with Lasso Regression can lead to models that generalize better to unseen data by reducing overfitting.\n",

    "Addressing Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is effective at handling multicollinearity, a condition where predictor variables are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "By selecting a subset of predictors and shrinking the coefficients of correlated predictors towards zero, Lasso Regression mitigates the multicollinearity problem and produces more stable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "Computational Efficiency:\n",

    "Compared to other feature selection techniques that involve exhaustive search or manual trial-and-error, Lasso Regression offers a computationally efficient approach to feature selection.\n",

    "Relative Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the magnitudes of non-zero coefficients can provide insights into the relative importance of predictors in the Lasso Regression model.\n",
    "Predictors with larger non-zero coefficients are considered more influential in predicting the target variable, while predictors with smaller non-zero coefficients have less impact.\n",
